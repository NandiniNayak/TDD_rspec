What is TDD
It is a process of writing test cases first for a specific use case (user story/ requirement) and then writing the code to pass the test
Why should we practice TDD
 - writing code first means you get biased by your code and basically you are testing the code and not the requirement.
 - tes scripts written once can be run over and over again even after the code is refactored and the expectation is the test ahould pass.
 
how should we approach TDD
    - create a failing test
    - write just enough code to pass the test
    - refactor your code to improve its design.

list down the test cases again the user story / requirement.
write the test sec/ script
code to pass the test
refactor the code
test to pass
